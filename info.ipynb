    "To create a Git repository on your local Mac and upload it online for others to use, you'll need to follow these steps. This guide assumes you will be using GitHub as your online repository host, but the steps are similar for other platforms like GitLab or Bitbucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Install Git\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ensure you have Git installed on your Mac. You can check if Git is installed by opening your terminal and typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If Git is not installed, you can install it via Homebrew (a package manager for macOS) or directly from the Git website.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Install via Homebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install Homebrew (if you haven't already)**:\n",
    "   Open your terminal and run:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install Git using Homebrew**:\n",
    "   After Homebrew is installed, run:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   brew install git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Install Directly\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download Git**:\n",
    "   Go to the [Git Downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and download the macOS version.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install**:\n",
    "   Open the downloaded `.dmg` file and follow the installation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create a Local Git Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Terminal**: You can find it in Applications > Utilities or by searching for \"Terminal\" in Spotlight.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Directory**: Navigate to the location where you want to create your project folder and create it:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   mkdir my-project\n",
    "   cd my-project\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize Git**: Inside the project folder, run:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git init\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add Files**: Add your project files to the directory. You can use any text editor to create files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Stage and Commit**:\n",
    "   - Stage the files for commit:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git add .\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Commit the changes:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git commit -m \"Initial commit\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create an Online Repository (e.g., GitHub)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sign In or Create an Account**:\n",
    "   Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and sign in or create a new account.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a New Repository**:\n",
    "   - Click on the \"+\" icon in the upper right corner and select \"New repository.\"\n",
    "   - Fill in the repository name (e.g., `my-project`), description, and choose visibility (public or private).\n",
    "   - Click \"Create repository.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Link Local Repository to Online Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Get Repository URL**: After creating the repository, you will see a page with the repository URL. It will look something like this:\n",
    "   - HTTPS: `https://github.com/YourUsername/my-project.git`\n",
    "   - SSH: `git@github.com:YourUsername/my-project.git`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add Remote Origin**: Go back to your terminal, and inside your project directory, link your local repository to the online repository using:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git remote add origin https://github.com/YourUsername/my-project.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Push Local Repository to Online Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Push Your Code**: To upload your local repository to GitHub, run:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git push -u origin master\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   If you're using a newer version of Git, the default branch might be `main` instead of `master`. In that case, use:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git push -u origin main\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "1. Install Git on your Mac.\n",
    "2. Create a local Git repository and commit your files.\n",
    "3. Create a new repository on GitHub (or another platform).\n",
    "4. Link your local repository to the online repository.\n",
    "5. Push your local changes to the online repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed these steps, your project will be available online for other users to access, clone, and contribute to."

    "**SOLUTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "The error message you're seeing indicates that GitHub has removed support for password authentication for operations like `git push` and `git pull` as of August 13, 2021. Instead, GitHub now recommends using **personal access tokens** (PAT) or SSH keys for authentication. Here’s how you can resolve this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (PAT)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:\n",
    "   - Go to your GitHub account and click on your profile picture in the upper right corner, then select **Settings**.\n",
    "   - In the left sidebar, click on **Developer settings**.\n",
    "   - Click on **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.\n",
    "   - Click on **Generate new token**.\n",
    "   - Give your token a descriptive name, select the scopes (permissions) you need (for basic Git operations, `repo` is typically sufficient), and click **Generate token**.\n",
    "   - **Copy the token**; you won’t be able to see it again.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use the Token for Authentication**:\n",
    "   - When prompted for your password while pushing or pulling, enter the personal access token instead of your GitHub password.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Using SSH Keys\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**:\n",
    "   - Open your terminal and run:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ls -al ~/.ssh\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Check if you have files named `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub` or similar. If they exist, you already have an SSH key.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate a New SSH Key (if you don't have one)**:\n",
    "   - Run the following command in your terminal, replacing `you@example.com` with your email address:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C \"you@example.com\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - When prompted, you can accept the default file location by pressing Enter. You can also set a passphrase for added security.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent**:\n",
    "   - Start the SSH agent:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     eval \"$(ssh-agent -s)\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Add your SSH key:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account**:\n",
    "   - Copy the SSH public key to your clipboard:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Go to GitHub, navigate to **Settings** > **SSH and GPG keys**.\n",
    "   - Click on **New SSH key**, paste your key in the \"Key\" field, and give it a title. Click **Add SSH key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use SSH URL for Your Repository**:\n",
    "   - Update your remote URL to use the SSH format:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:jayeshanand/My_Repo.git\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Test the SSH Connection**:\n",
    "   - You can test if your SSH key is working by running:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     ssh -T git@github.com\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - You should see a message like \"Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- **For HTTPS**: Use a personal access token instead of a password.\n",
    "- **For SSH**: Set up SSH keys and use the SSH URL for your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "After setting up either method, you should be able to push and pull from your GitHub repository without issues."
